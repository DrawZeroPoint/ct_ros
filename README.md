This repository contains robotics examples for the [control toolbox](https://ethz-adrl.github.io/ct/). If you have not installed the control toolbox yet, please go [here](https://ethz-adrl.github.io/ct/) for the source-code.
Link to the [documentation](https://ethz-adrl.github.io/ct/) of the control toolbox. If you are familiar with the basic concepts of
the CTs optimal control solvers and robot models, you can find more complex and demanding application examples in this repository.

## Earlier Versions

Earlier versions up to control toolbox release v2.3 are hosted on bitbucket, they can be found at https://bitbucket.org/adrlab/ct_ros
It is, however, recommended to ignore those legacy versions from bitbucket and work with this maintained release.

## Requirements
 * tested under Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04
 * requires ROS Kinetic or later
